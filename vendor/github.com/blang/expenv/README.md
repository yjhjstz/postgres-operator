expenv - Expand environment variables [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/blang/expenv.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/blang/expenv)
======
Expenv replaces ${var} or $var in the input to the values of the current environment variables. Supports stdin/stdout and files.

There is also a newer version available, [expenv.sh](https://github.com/blang/expenv.sh), written as shell script.

Usage
-----
```bash
$ go get github.com/blang/expenv
$ $GOPATH/bin/expenv -f inputfile
```

If you don't want to build it, you might want to download the [ELF x86-64 binary](https://github.com/blang/expenv/releases/latest) of the latest release (build by travis-ci).

Examples
-----

```bash
$ expenv -f inputfile > outputfile
$ expenv < inputfile > outputfile
$ expenv -i -f inputfile // Replace inplace
```

Example input:
```
My PWD is $PWD
Whoami: ${USER}
I'm using $TERM
Expand $empty but don't expand $$empty
Don't expand $(echo empty)
```

As mentioned in the above example, two special cases exist:

* `$$` is converted to `$`, allowing you to pass in literal-dollar-signs
* `$(` is not converted, allowing your input to contain subshell like behaviour

Motivation
-----

I need to make config files more dynamic using environment variables. In a docker environment this is a big issue for me.
